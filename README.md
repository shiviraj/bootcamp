## I 
1. As a math student, I want to represent a rectangle, so that I will be able to calculate area.
2. As a math student, I want to represent a rectangle, so that I will be able to calculate the perimeter.
3. As a math student, I want to represent a square, so that I can calculate its area and perimeter.


## II
1. As a math student, I want to represent a chance of getting tails when flipping a coin.
2. As a math student, I want to represent a chance of NOT getting tails when flipping a coin.
3. As a math student, I want to represent a chance of getting tails when flipping two coins.
4. As a math student, I want to represent a chance of getting at least one tails when flipping two coins.

         De morgan's law: P(A||B) = !(!P(A) && !P(B))


## III
1. As a math student, I wish to compare lengths in feet and inches. 
    
        1ft = 12in
2. As a math student, I wish to compare lengths in inches and centimeters.
    
        2in = 5cm
        
3. As a math student, I wish to compare lengths in centimeters and millimeters.

        1cm = 10mm
        
4. As a math student, I wish to compare volumes in liter and gallon.

        1 gallon = 3.78 liters 
        
5. As a math student, I want to be able to add two lengths in inches.
       
        2in + 2in = 4in
        
6. As a math student, I want to be able to add two lengths in any unit, and the standard output is inches.

        2in + 2.5cm = 3in
        
7. As a math student, I want to be able to add two volumes in any unit, and the standard output is liters.

        1 gallon + 1 liter = 4.78 liters
         
### IV 

1. As a parking lot attendant, I want to park a car.

2. As a parking lot attendant, I want to know when the park is full.

3. As a parking lot attendant, I want to handle more than one parking lot.
 
4. As a parking lot attendant, I want an assistant to monitor the same parking lots as me and update a display.

5. As a parking lot manager, I want to know when the lot is 80% full so that I don't assign that lot to a trainee.

6. As a parking lot attendant, I want to know when the lot is 20% or less occupied so that I can promote the lot.
